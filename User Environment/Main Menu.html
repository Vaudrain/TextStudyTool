          Click here to participate in a test. The test should take around <b>20 minutes</b> to complete. You may particpate in as many tests as you like, but the data gathered is most helpful when you wait at least a day between tests.

        </p>
        <p>
          Each section is split into subsections. In each subsection, you will be given a type of token to input and an onscreen prompt(for example, sentences or single words). You will be have a timer of <b>1 minute</b> for each subsection, you should input as many tokens as possible as quickly as you can while making as few mistakes as possible.
