      <p>Thank you for your interest in this study. You have not yet been entered into the study. In order to participate in this study, you must have a <b>device and browser compatible with the HTML5 gamepad API</b>. Known configurations are shown here, please click the device you own below:</p>

      <button class="accordion">Xbox 360 Gamepad</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Please go to <a href="http://html5gamepad.com/">html5gamepad.com</a> and <a href=http://daisywheeljs.org/>daisywheeljs.org</a> and verify that your device is showing up and operating correctly in those two places. This study uses the same tools, so if your device does not appear there, it will not work here. If your device is showing up there, but not working here, please email <b>Nicholas Bentley</b> at <i>nxb484@student.bham.ac.uk</i> with details of your setup.</p>

      <p>Other devices and browsers may also work, though they have not been tested and may therefore cause unknown behaviour. In order to determine whether or not your browser has successfully detected your input device please <a href="http://html5gamepad.com/">open this site</a> and <a href=http://daisywheeljs.org/>this site</a> in new windows/tabs and test your inputs (please note that functionality also differs from Operating System to Operating System - if something looks wrong, it probably is! If you encounter an error that you believe is the fault of this site please email <b>Nicholas Bentley</b> at <i>nxb484@student.bham.ac.uk</i>).</p>
