          <p>Please go to <a href="http://html5gamepad.com/">html5gamepad.com</a> and <a href=http://daisywheeljs.org/>daisywheeljs.org</a> and verify that your device is showing up and operating correctly in those two places. This study uses the same tools, so if your device does not appear there, it will not work here. If your device is showing up there, but not working here, please email <b>Nicholas Bentley</b> at <i>nxb484@student.bham.ac.uk</i> with details of your setup.</p>

          <p>There are many factors that could impact the functionality of your device, a few primary factors to check are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Browser Compatibility - here is a list of known good browsers for this device:
              <ul>

                <li>Google Chrome</li>

            <li>Operating System Compatibility:
              <ul>
                <li>Windows</li>
                <li>Linux</li>

        <p>Other devices and browsers may also work, though they have not been tested and may therefore cause unknown behaviour. In order to determine whether or not your browser has successfully detected your input device please <a href="http://html5gamepad.com/">open this site</a> and <a href=http://daisywheeljs.org/>this site</a> in new windows/tabs and test your inputs (please note that functionality also differs from Operating System to Operating System - if something looks wrong, it probably is! If you encounter an error that you believe is the fault of this site please email <b>Nicholas Bentley</b> at <i>nxb484@student.bham.ac.uk</i>).</p>

      <button class="accordion">2: I don't know what to do now.</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have not yet completed the weekly test on the Main Menu, please do that. If you have, please return within the next week or so and perform a repeat test, and if possible repeat this process at least twice. This data is most useful if you leave a gap between tests! Thank you for your help with this study!</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">3: I've found a bug!</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Excellent! Please email <b>Nicholas Bentley</b> at <i>nxb484@student.bham.ac.uk</i> with details of the bug, and ideally a method for reproducing the error.</p>

      <button class="accordion">4: I have concerns about this study or would like my data to be withdrawn.</button>
      <div class="panel">
